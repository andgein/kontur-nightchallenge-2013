;Oh well, I don't know much (anything, really) about progamming in '88, so
;I'm not expecting to do that well here (unless Myer fails to come up with a
;warrior again :-) ). What this is: just a 33% c self-splitting vampire stone,
;with a dat coreclearing pit - the stone jumps to the pit at the end of the
;bombing run - in '94, it scores 93 Wilkes or 103 Wilbez, and gets thrashed
;by Timescapes (no worries), Cannonade and Bluefunk (bigger worries - not
;sure how big). As for what Myer will come up with, I have no idea...
;hopefully I will do better than I did last time :-)
